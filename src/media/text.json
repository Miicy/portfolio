	"text": "I'm a Web Developer with a passion for crafting creative and user-friendly web experiences, specializing in React.  My journey into the world of web design and development was inspired by my innate creativity and love for art. I've found that the digital canvas of the web allows me to merge my artistic sensibilities with problem-solving skills, creating visually appealing and functional websites. \nI'm truly enthusiastic about discovering new things and putting them to use in my work. The ever-evolving nature of web development ensures there's always something fresh to explore. Therefore, I am not only eager to expand my skills into backend development and Three.js, but also actively engage in continuous learning and exploration. I am currently dedicating my free time to self-study and online courses to gain proficiency in mentioned areas. \nWhen I'm not immersed in code and design, you can find me exploring new art, gaming, spending time in nature and enjoying moments with my loyal companion.
